# Development process

Tox4j is a software project with very high security and stability requirements. It will potentially be used by hundreds of millions of people around the world. A security issue could have catastrophic consequences. Slightly less critical, but still very important, is stability. If the library underlying our Android app is unstable, it's annoying in the mildest case, and can be catastrophic to a single person (imagine the code arbitrarily deleting chat histories).

Therefore, tox4j-team operates in a slightly different way from most open source projects. We have strict design and code review processes that no contributor, including the project owners, can violate. We have software managing our source code repository that ensures the code review process is followed.

For any non-trivial development, we follow a rigorous design process. This process ensures that every decision is founded in reason and that at least some alternatives for the decisions have been considered. We split the design into two stages with a document accompanying each stage. For reviews, we use a collaborative editing environment that allows for suggestions and inline comments (e.g. Google Docs).

## Goals, requirements, overview

The first stage is the design overview. This document contains the high level overview of a design. It starts by answering the following questions:

* What is the current state of the world? We describe a problem and outline a solution with the currently available technology. This establishes the background for our design.
* What do we want the world to look like? This part describes at a high level what the new technology is intended to do, what problems it solves, and in particular, how the problem described in the previous section will be solved in a better way using this new technology.
* What are the goals of this design?
* Where does the scope of our design end? What is *not* a goal of this design?

Next comes a list of requirements. For example:

* What kind of data sizes does our system operate on?
* How reliable does it need to be?
* How general or how specific does it need to be?
* How extensible does it need to be?

The largest section of this document is the high level design overview. Here we describe, without going into implementation details, what components the solution will be comprised of, how they interact, and how they depend on each other. For tooling, this may include usage examples. For code, this won't include API definitions. This part may discuss storage choices, protocol choices, and other high level design ideas.

Finally, the document includes a section discussing alternative approaches. The discussion gives a short description of a technology that solves a similar problem to ours, provides a link to the documentation of that technology, and points out reasons for not choosing it.

This document forms the basis for discussion, and we require at least one reviewer (if possible, two reviewers) to sign off on the idea. Ideally, we have many more people commenting and suggesting on the document.

## Detailed technical design

After going through several iterations of discussion and improvement, the rough design is expanded to become a full technical design. This is a separate document, which may initially be a copy of the above document. It specifies the APIs in detail, with message types, effects, and result types. These can be language-specific or language-agnostic such as web or RPC APIs. The evolution of this document usually goes hand in hand with the actual implementation.

## Writing code

In many open source projects, the people with write access to the source code repository will submit code frequently and break things in the process. The breakage is then hopefully resolved. In contrast, tox4j-team does not allow a single line of code (or documentation) to enter the master branch of the main repository without being reviewed by at least one member that did not write the code. This means that even tox4j-team members cannot push arbitrary unreviewed code to the repository. The exception to this rule are rollbacks of the most recently accepted pull request, which may be performed without review (since it will revert the state of the repository to an already reviewed point in time).

If you want to contribute code or documentation, you will go through the normal Github process of forking the repository and opening a pull request. You will then find your pull request on [the code review site](https://upsource.slevermann.de/tox-j/reviews) with reviewers from tox4j-team added to it, who will read and comment on your submission. You will most likely receive actionable feedback, which you can discuss on the review. You can then add more commits to the review by pushing them to the pull request branch. If you feel that you have addressed a comment, click "Resolve". The commit messages of your secondary commits (the ones that were added to address comments) won't matter, as they will be automatically collapsed into a single "Review progression" commit once the PR is approved. When the reviewer or reviewers approved your change, you can close the code review ("Close review" button), after which the PR will be merged.

A continuous integration system will build the code on an x86\_64 machine and run an exhaustive testsuite to increase confidence in the changes. After the code is accepted, a secondary CI system will build the code for the Android platform.
