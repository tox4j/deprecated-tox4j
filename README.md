# tox4j

New and improved java wrapper for Tox.

## Dependencies

### Java

* sbt
* protobuf-java (This is pulled in by sbt, to be the exact same version as protoc. protoc needs to be on $PATH for this to work correctly.)

### Native code

* CMake (>= 2.8.7)
* Toxcore
* Toxav
* protobuf (The version used in development is currently 2.6.1, other versions might work as well)
* clang-3.5 (older versions of clang segfault. G++ support is untested, the build script enforces clang-3.5 for now. If you do not have clang 3.5 installed, your build may fail.)

## Building

Build and install toxcore and toxav. Run the sbt console with ```sbt```, and then use ```compile``` to build, ```test``` to run unit tests (these are a lot of tests with high timeouts, might take 40minutes or longer), and ```package``` to create a jar and the needed native library.

### Developing on Mac OS X

Getting the required tools for development on OS X is very easy. If you have XCode installed, you will already be ready to compile the C++ part of tox4j, otherwise you will need to install a C++ compiler with brew. To get started, follow these instructions.

Execute the following commands in a Mac terminal:
```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir homebrew && curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew
```

Now, edit your `~/.bash\_profile` file and add this line to the end:
```
export PATH=$HOME/homebrew/bin:$PATH
```

Restart your terminal or `exec $SHELL`.

Install required packages:
```
$ brew tap Tox/tox
$ brew install libtoxcore pkg-config protobuf sbt 
```

Now, toxcore should be installed in your `$HOME`. Finally, clone and build tox4j:
```
$ cd ~/code/git
$ git clone https://github.com/tox4j/tox4j  # or your fork
$ cd tox4j
$ sbt
```

In the SBT console, run the following commands to build and test tox4j:
```
> compile
> test
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you get an error saying something about Java target versions not being correct, run `javac -version` and `java -version` and see if the version numbers are the same. If they are not, run `ls -l $(which javac)` and the same for `java` and change one of them to the newer one using `sudo ln -sf`.

If you don't have a C++ compiler (e.g. from XCode), install it with brew:
```
$ brew install llvm --with-clang
```

### IntelliJ IDEA on Mac OS X

Building:

1. Download and install IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala "Featured plugin" enabled. If you already have IDEA, install the Scala plugin in the plugins section of the settings.
2. In the Welcome dialogue, select "Open", select the tox4j directory in the file chooser, press "Choose".
3. In the "Import Project from SBT" dialogue, select "Use auto-import", "Download sources and docs", and select a project SDK. If you don't have a project SDK, set one up with "New...". The Java SDKs are usually in `/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines`.
4. Install the "Google Protocol Buffers support" plugin in Preferences > Plugins.
5. Restart the IDE.
6. The IDE will now tell you "Protocol Facet framework is detected". Click "Configure". The dialogue will list 2 proto files. Click "OK".
7. Now the IDE will ask you to set the output directory. Set it to the `target/scala-2.11/src\_managed/main/compiled\_protobuf` directory in the tox4j project root.
8. Set the Protobuf compiler in "Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Protocol Buffers Compiler" to `$HOME/homebrew/bin/protoc`, where `$HOME` is `/Users/yourname`.
9. Select the menu entry "Build > Make Project".

Running tests:

1. Secondary mouse button click on the tox4j project root (Ctrl-click, two-finger-tap, ...), "Create 'All Tests'".
2. Add to "VM options": `-Djava.library.path=target/cpp/bin`
3. Clear the field "Working directory", which is set to `$MODULE_DIR$`.

#### Troubleshooting

If you get an error about source and target versions not being 1.7 ("Error:java: javacTask: source release 1.7 requires target release 1.7"), go to "Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler" and select "1.7" from the dropdown list for "Project bytecode version".

If you get "Av" or "Core" already defined errors, try setting the Protobuf Facet output directory to target/generated and adding target/generated as a sources directory in "File > Project Structure".

If SBT project import fails, try importing the IDEA modules from `project/idea-modules`.
