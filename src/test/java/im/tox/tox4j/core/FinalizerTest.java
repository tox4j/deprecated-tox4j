 * These tests solely exist to exercise the C++ code paths that deal with closing and finalisation. If the C++ code has

 * Although {@link System#gc()} doesn't necessarily perform a GC, on the Oracle JVM it actually does reliably do so.
 * Thus, these tests don't formally test anything, but in reality they do.
