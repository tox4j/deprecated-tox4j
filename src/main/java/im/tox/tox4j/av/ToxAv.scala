/**
 * Public audio/video API for Tox clients.
 *
 * This API can handle multiple calls. Each call has its state, in very rare
 * occasions the library can change the state of the call without apps knowledge.
 *
 * Like the Core API, this API is fully thread-safe. The library will ensure
 * the proper synchronisation of parallel calls.
 *
 * A common way to run ToxAv (multiple or single instance) is to have a thread,
 * separate from tox instance thread, running a simple [[ToxAv#iterate]] loop,
 * sleeping for [[ToxAv#iterationInterval]] * milliseconds on each iteration.
 *
 * Each ToxAv instance can be bound to only one Tox instance, and Tox instance
 * can have only one ToxAv instance. One must make sure to close ToxAv instance
 * prior to closing the Tox instance otherwise undefined behaviour occurs. Upon
 * closing of ToxAv instance, all active calls will be forcibly terminated without
 * notifying peers.
